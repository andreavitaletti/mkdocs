# It is time to Work with a real device

[Lastminuteengineers](https://lastminuteengineers.com/getting-started-with-esp32/) and [Random Nerd Tutorial](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/projects-esp32/) are plenty of excellent examples to integrate a multitude of sensors and actuators, and to interact with a number of protocols.

!!! fact

    Exactly the same code you wrote in the simulator, works on the real device, **but in the real device you can do even more!**

* You can easily download the code from Wokwi in the form of a zip project file.

* One convenient possibility is to use [Arduino IDE](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360019833020-Download-and-install-Arduino-IDE) 
* Since we are using the ESP32, you have to follow these [intructions](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/)
* Select the DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1 as in the picture below and upload the code

* Another option is to use [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/). In particular I like the [vscode extension](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/vscode.html). 
* To work with the ESP32, this is the minimal setup for the platformio.ini file

```
[env:esp32dev]
platform = espressif32
board = esp32dev
framework = arduino

; Custom Serial Monitor port
monitor_port = /dev/ttyUSB0

; Custom Serial Monitor speed (baud rate)
monitor_speed = 115200
```

## From [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) to a real device

1. Compile the code and on the code editor press F1 to download the firmware. It is a .bin file, let's name it sketch.bin file 
2. ```
   esptool.py --chip esp32 --port "/dev/ttyUSB0" --baud 921600  --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash  -z --flash_mode keep --flash_freq keep --flash_size keep 0x1000 "bootloader.bin" 0x8000 "partitions.bin" 0xe000 "boot_app0.bin" 0x10000 "sketch.bin"
   ```
Once partitions and bootloader are uploaded, you can simply upload the sketch. To upload for the first time the partitions and the bootloader you can simply used arduino IDE 

3. ```
   esptool.py --chip esp32 --port "/dev/ttyUSB0" --baud 921600  --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash  -z --flash_mode keep --flash_freq keep --flash_size keep 0x10000 ./sketch.bin 
   ```

In principle you can even use a [Web tool](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-metro-esp32-s2/web-serial-esptool)
