# IoT short course

This short course on the Internet of Things is designed to give a first understanding of the main issues in developing IoT solutions. We do believe the most efficient way to learn this subject is experimenting, this is way the course encourage attendants to hands-on. No specific background is needed, even if a basic knowledge of electronics and computer science might help.
