The course is based on the book by Ash Maurya "[Running Lean: Iterate from plan A to a plan that works](https://www.leanfoundry.com/books/running-lean)" and [https://www.leanfoundry.com/](https://www.leanfoundry.com/)

In particular we will focus on 

* PART I:DESIGN
* PART II: VALIDATION. 

Due to the limited time of the course, we will only marginally consider PART III: GROWTH.
